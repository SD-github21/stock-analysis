# Overview of Green Energy Stocks Analysis
## An analysis of green energy stocks was conducted in order to examine the performance of each of these green energy stocks. The results of this analysis were intended to be utilized to help with decision-making processes about the best green energy stocks to invest in. The analysis entailed developing a macro to calculate important metrics to establish which green energy stocks performed well according to two target years, i.e., 2017 and 2018. The purpose of the current analysis was to determine if refactoring code in VBA enhances the ability for that code to run more quickly and efficiently.
